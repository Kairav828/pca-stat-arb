# ðŸ“ˆ PCA-Based Statistical Arbitrage

This project explores a trading strategy that looks for **temporary mispricings in related stocks** and profits when prices return to normal.

## What This Project Does

### 1. Finds Groups of Stocks That Move Together  
I have analyzed stocks from similar sectors to find shared movement patterns.  
(*Uses PCA â€“ Principal Component Analysis â€“ to reduce correlated stock returns into independent factors.*)

### 2. Spots When One Stock Breaks Away from the Group  
When a stock drifts too far from the groupâ€™s trend, it might be mispriced â€” and I try to profit from that.  
(*Regress each stockâ€™s return on the PCA components and measure the difference â€“ the residual â€“ as a signal.*)

### 3. Triggers Buy/Sell Signals Based on That Deviation  
If the deviation is big, I take a position expecting it to return to normal.  
(*We use Z-score thresholds for mean reversion trading signals.*)

### 4. Tests How Well the Strategy Would Have Worked  
We simulate past trades and calculate profits, risk, and performance.  
(*Includes a backtester and metrics like Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and PnL curve.*)

### 5. Shows Results in an Interactive Web Dashboard  
You can tweak inputs and instantly see how the strategy changes.  
(*Built using Streamlit for live visualization and interactivity.*)
